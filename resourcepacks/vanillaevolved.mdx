## FAQ
     **Can you make a Bedrock Port ?**

     - Currently focus is only on java edition and there is no bedrock port of my projects.

     **Can i make a Bedrock port on your behalf ?**

    - it is possible only for PERSONAL USE

     **Compability with fresh animations resourcepack ?**

    - There is currently no official support for Fresh Animations compatibility, but alternatively you can add the Fresh Animations resourcepack to the top of your resourcepack list. This ONLY replaces the "mob textures" with the default textures to avoid any problems.

    **Pack version warning ?**

    There is a high chance that resource packs will work with different versions of Minecraft without the need to change the version of the pack, unless there is a major update that breaks resource packs, which you can report on Github.

    **Shader issue with grass/flower model ?**

    To fix this, you can turn off the Waving effect in your Shaderpack settings.

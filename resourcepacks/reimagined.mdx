## About

Reimagined is as the name suggests, a reimagined vision of Minecraft to simply feel more lived in and alive. Reimagined is a quite big pack and have hundreds of features. From hundreds of randomized mob and block variants, to dozens of animated blocks & items. To even the small things such as consistent color palettes, pixel consistency, loads of retouched and updated textures aswell as models!

The vision for Reimagined is to hopefully be able to immerse yourself as much as possible in Minecraft's cube world, while still trying to stay true to Minecraft's core simplicity and feel.

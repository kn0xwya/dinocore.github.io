For this pack, I'm aiming to keep it vanilla the most possible. I like to say that this pack is for people that doesn't like to use pack. All changes are small update to the base game to make it look a bit more natural with better transition, alternate textures or better models. This is the main reason with most of my packs are separated . I want people to be able to choose what they want in their game and how far they are ready to go with it. Most of my pack are standalone except for ADDON which require this pack to work as intended.

## About 
Mandala GUI is an elegant theme, in the style of Mandala Creations. It is specifically made for people who like Dark mode. It only changes the UI of Minecraft, without changing items or blocks.

## Features

    - UI in Dark mode.
    - Flat and modern colors.
    - Blue-gray color palette.
    + Compatible with mods [list of mods can be found in the file description]
    - I also update the list of compatible mods as these mods are requested and popular [so everyone enjoys].

He worked on the White mode and Mega Dark mode versions, and several colors [aqua, purple, pinky, crimson, and honey], when they are finished I will post a link. ‚ù§

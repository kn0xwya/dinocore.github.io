Better Leaves adds additional layers to leaf blocks, making them appear more bushy, dense and natural.

This resourcepack adds no textures, making it compatible with almost all resourcepacks and mods out of the box (the textures adjust dynamically)

<Tip>I strongly recommend installing the [Cull Leaves](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/cull-leaves) mod alongside Sodium/Embeddium to get more FPS.</Tip>

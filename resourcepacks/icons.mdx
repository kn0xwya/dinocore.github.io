## 📋 About

Icons adds icons to menus, items, subtitles, GUI's... just everywhere you could imagine them fitting

The pack makes use of Custom Unicode Characters and Minecraft language files to add said icons

## ⚙️ Compatibility

This pack is compatible with all resource packs, as long as it stays at the top of the resource packs selection

We cannot guarantee that Icons will work with packs that change the font of Minecraft nor mods that make use of strings that we work with since it was made with the default textures and vanilla in mind

## ❓ How to use

    - Drop the pack into your resource packs folder, or Drag and Drop it in the Resource pack selection.
    - Select Icons.
    (Have it on top of other packs if you use more)
    - Select the language in which you want to play
    - “Force Unicode” must be turned to “off”!
    - Enjoy!

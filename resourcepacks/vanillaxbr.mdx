## About
This is a Resource Pack that gives the game a smooth but familiar look.

If you want textures that preserve the essence of the originals and don't over-detail then this is the pack for you. Pixels are accurately blended into each other to create a more high-defenition version of the Minecraft textures. The effect can be so subtle that it appears vanilla from a distance.

VanillaXBR utilises an image-upscaling algorithm in creating parts of its textures which ensures that nothing of the vanilla Minecraft look is lost.

So if you love Vanilla, look no further than this!

## How was this made?
This resource pack utilises a [scaling method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel-art_scaling_algorithms#2%C3%97SaI) on the textures called 'xBR'. If you've used a retro console emulator before then you may recognise it.

xBR was made by [Hyllian](https://github.com/Hyllian) to upscale pixel art four times its original size. I'd like to give credit to him, as this pack would have not been possible without it.

The tools I used to utilise the xBR algorithm outside of the emulators it was designed for were scripted versions of [ImageResizer](https://github.com/Hawkynt/2dimagefilter) and [Zenju's xBRZ.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbrz/) I then went into [paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/) to edit and combine textures in post. Feel free to make your own xBR Resource Packs by upscaling your own textures! I would love to see what you come up with.

[NEW] Introducing [PackXBR!](https://packxbr.f53.dev/) The easiest way to make your own textures fit with VanillaXBR.

## A lazy upscale is a bad upscale.
(disclaimer) While most upscale projects take a hands-off approach to upscaling, VanillaXBR stands out. It's an iterative process where I upscale, layer, refine and etch each part of a texture manually. I give care and attention to make sure that the textures produced are of the highest possible quality with no compromises.

Unlike an AI-based algorithm, xBR is a meticulously designed scaling algorithm that I hold in high regard and use in a way that respects its capabilities.

    - In this pack, I try to improves, upgrades and repairs a lot of things while keeping the Vanilla style.
    - This pack is NOT designed for Fast Graphics!
    - OptiFine is NOT required but you will see more differences by playing with it (or with mods CIT Resewn, CEM etc.).
    - Ignore any messages about the pack being incompatible with the game version if they appear.
    - Feel free to report all issues, feedback and concerns directly to me in [DMs on CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/private-messages/send?recipient=kryqu_).

    - If you play with mods, [check out addon](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/vanilla-exp-mods) that supports some of them (Fabric 1.20.1).

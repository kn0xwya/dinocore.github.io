Dramatic Skys is an add on pack that will make the skies in your game HD with realistic clouds and lighting. This pack works with any other resource pack, just simply add it over the other pack on the selection screen!

This pack is performance friendly as well, so even the simplest of computers and laptops can use it easily without issue! This pack will vary a lot from my other packs, as it has MANY skies in it. Every area will have a sky that will vary depending on the biomes of Minecraft. This resource pack, as the title entails, will be the ultimate resource pack for sky textures.

This is a large and ambitious project given there are a total of 79 biomes as of 1.20x. Each of these will have a day sky, sunset/sunrise, and a night sky; Making your Minecraft World more dynamic and realistic.

**New to the pack:**

  - Animated Auroras
  - Shooting stars
  - Meteor showers -Animated Sun
  - Color and Fog Maps
  - Height based sky textures
  - Fabric Support
  - Tornados
  - **More coming soon**

**Newest Addition: Tornados**

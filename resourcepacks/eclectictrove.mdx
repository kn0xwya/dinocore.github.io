<Info> This resource pack **requires** the mod [Legendary Tooltips.](https://modrinth.com/mod/legendary-tooltips) It will not work without it.</Info>

## About
This resource pack replaces the default "level 0" border built into Legendary Tooltips, and provides 9 additional custom borders for use as you see fit for your game/modpack.  If you would like to use this resource pack without worrying about configuration, download the "noconfig" version of the pack.  This version contains a built-in configuration that works well for vanilla and some mods.

If you would like more granular control over what items show what borders, please note that you will need to configure Legendary Tooltips yourself.  Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/AHilyard/LegendaryTooltips/wiki/Configuration-Instructions), **please** read that first.

The borders in this pack are quite varied (see images). Here are all of the borders included, with their associated configuration numbers:

0.  Gold frame
1.  Silver frame
2.  Copper frame
3.  Smoke and flames
4.  Water / Ice
5.  Rose and vines
6.  Bones / death
7.  Iron plating / machinery
8.  Purple geometric motif
9.  Holy (halo / wings)

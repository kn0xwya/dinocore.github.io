**Fresh Animations** is a work in progress resource pack that gives an animation overhaul to the creatures in the default look of Minecraft. The aim is to make the mobs more dynamic and believable.

<img height="200" noZoom src="/images/fa-optifine.png" />
This resource pack uses an OptiFine feature called custom entity models (CEM) to add new models and animations.

<Warning>**IT WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY WITHOUT THIS FEATURE!**</Warning>

As an alternative to Optifine, the combination of Entity Model Features and Entity Texture Features can be used for CEM features.

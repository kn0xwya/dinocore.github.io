Hey! I made a mod with this resource pack to resolve boss mod compatibility bugs (like Cataclysm or Aether) and some other bugs like the boss bar showing in chat instead of the boss name (which isn't a bug actually, it's because of how the resource pack works). The mod is now available [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/enhanced-boss-bars-mod)

Enhanced Boss Bars is a project that aims to improve all the boss bars so that there is a better immersion in the amazing world of minecraft, since the default bars are very uncreative. If you have any suggestions for a mod boss, please comment on the CurseForge page and I'll put it on the mod list :)

I hope you enjoy it and thank you very much for watching.

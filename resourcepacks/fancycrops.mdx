## About ðŸŒ¾
This little resource pack reworks the vanilla crop model and adds variations to crop textures! It also retextures seeds and the hay bale block.

It was built to work with [Farmer's Delight.](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight) The fluffy crop model should be compatible with all mods that add crops.

Feel free to look at the gallery for pictures. I hope it makes your farming experience feel a tiny bit more alive!

## Compatibility
You might get an in-game "made for a newer version of Minecraft" warning if you're not playing on the latest version. You can freely ignore it if you're playing on a version the resource pack file is tagged with.

Does not require any mods to work.

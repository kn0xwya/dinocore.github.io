<Info>While using this resource pack, make sure it's __above__ Programmer Art, or it may not work correctly.</Info>

The [Texture Update](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Texture_Update) has been officially released in Java Edition 1.14, while some players still prefer the old textures. Then the built-in-game resource pack, **Programmer Art**, which is officially provided by Mojang, has been available until now. However, it still involves many issues, even after SEVEN major updates have released! And that's why I've made this pack.

This resource pack is also attempting to fix issues in Programmer Art. Some texture issues fixed in this pack can be found in [Mojira.](https://bugs.mojang.com/)

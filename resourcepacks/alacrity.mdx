## About 
This is where I put all my love for RPGs, Medieval, and Magic. I played Minecraft for a long time with different resource packs, until I decided to put together all the accumulated experience of what I like. The word Alacrity was chosen as my state of mind in which I was creating this pack. What's waiting for you here?


    - A full conversion of all textures in a new 32x resolution. Still recognizable but looks new
    - Crazy attention to detail
    - The spirit of magic and RPG games (Inspired by Warcraft, Harry Potter, Gothic, The Elder Scrolls and many other universes)
    - Incredible vegetation
    - A lot of custom 3D models of blocks and mobs (CEM)
    - Huge amount of alternative block textures
